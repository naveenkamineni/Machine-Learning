#ðŸŽ¯Machine Learning From Scratch

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that uses data and algorithms (sets of rules) to solve real-world problems. It involves teaching computers to make decisions and predictions based on data, without being explicitly programmed.

Data Science often uses tools like Excel formulas or Python libraries (such as NumPy and Pandas) to clean and prepare data for analysis. Machine Learning takes that data and applies algorithms to solve problems in various fields, utilizing mathematical concepts like linear algebra and logistic regression.
